# BR 193 "Vectron" Camera Driver

In real life, the Vectron eletrical locomotives can be configured with Backwards-facing Cameras from each Cabdoors. The 3D-Model in TSW actually has them modelled, but sadly, the Display doesn't have the Camera Page active. With this Mod, `@Foob` and i implemented the Cameras and the corresponding Page on the Machine Displays.
