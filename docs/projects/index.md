## Digital

As the original [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) doesn't feel very native to macOS and i need it on a weekly basis at University, i decided to create my own Fork of it and change it to be a bit more Native. This means using the macOS-Menubar, creating a .app-Bundle and a few smaller Things.

See [this Page](./digital.md) for more Informations about my fork.
