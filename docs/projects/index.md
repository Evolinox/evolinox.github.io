## Bar Counter

BarCounter is a self-service bar management app that tracks drink consumption, making it easy for patrons to manage and settle their tabs independently. Ideal for self-service bars, BarCounter records each drink taken by users, allowing staff and customers to see real-time beverage counts and total consumption. With BarCounter, venues can offer a streamlined, hassle-free experience for both guests and bar staff, ensuring accurate drink tracking and efficient payments.

See [this Page](./barcounter.md) for more Informations about this app.

## Digital

As the original [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) doesn't feel very native to macOS and i need it on a weekly basis at University, i decided to create my own Fork of it and change it to be a bit more Native. This means using the macOS-Menubar, creating a .app-Bundle and a few smaller Things.

See [this Page](./digital.md) for more Informations about my fork.
